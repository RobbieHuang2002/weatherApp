# weatherapp

this app was built using basic html, css and javascript to implement the API that is used 

this is a basic weather app that uses the openweather API to fetch data on certain cities that the user enters 

I plan on updating for a smore speicifc search of the location in which the user wants to find the weather for with a state/province search bar and a country search bar

I plan on updating the app for a easier use time by implementing a location tracker so the user does not need to enter the location manually every time they enter the site

I plan on updating this weather app with different background depending on the type of weather as well as a dynamic background in the future
